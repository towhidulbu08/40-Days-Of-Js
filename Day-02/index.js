// Variable is a container or strorage for data. It is used to store and manipulate data in a program. In JavaScript, we can declare variables using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.For example: A Box is a variable that can hold different items. We can put a toy in the box, then take it out and put a book in it. The box is like a variable that can store different values.
